# Colour basics

## What is colour?

Colour is not a physical property of light, it is the sensation experienced, and percieved in the brain. The electromatnetic spectrum has a range of frequencies that our eyes are sensitive to. Other animals have eyes that are sensitive to different frequencies of light, but generally these are close to the same range as ours.  Goldfish have the widest range of colour vision.

The electromagnetic and incorporates low frequency radio waves, to very high frequency gamma radiation.Imagine electromagnetic radiation as a electrical and magnetic energy wave travelling through space.

## The journey of a bit of light

### Source

Light originates from a source.  Sources of light can include:

- Stars (like the sun)
- Flames
- Light bulbs 
  - Tungsten (very hot metal)
  - Flourescent (Gases in low pressure in an electric field)
  - LEDs (Electronic semiconductor)

Different sources can produce light of different colour.

Is the sun the same colour through the day? Why might this be?

### Surface

Light might hit a surface before it enters our eyes. Surfaces interact with light by absorbing it. When light is absorbed by a surface, the light that bounces off the surface has passed some of its energy to the surface.  A surface will generally be very picky about the light that it absorbs.  

As an example white light that bounces off a red surface, the surface absorbs the light in the yellow to blue frequencies, only the red light bounces off.  

In art, and printing, When we mix paints/inks/pignents/dyes we are adjusting the surface that absorbs light. When we mix these we are *subtracting* parts of the reflected light. 

The subtractive primary colours are:
- Cyan
- Magenta
- Yellow
- There is an additional primary usually used, for convienice as balance is difficult - Black

In art when they talking about mixing colours, they are talking about **Subtractive Mixing**. They are mixing things that affect the surface, that light reflects off, not the light itself.

### Eye

When light reaches us it passes into our eyes, and is focussed on the back of the eye.  The surface of the back of the eye is called the retina. The retina has special cells which are sensitive to light. There are two types of cell in the retina, rods and cones.  Rods are sensitive to low light conditions, and are generally overstimulated during the day. Cones come in three varieties.

- Cones that are sensitive to Red light
- Cones that are sensitive to Green light
- Cones that are sensitive to Blue light

When the cones are sensitised, they send signals to the brain, which interprets these signals as colour.

## Light mixing

Interesting fact: Colour TV was invented before we understood cones. The colour phosphors as were used in the original colour tvs were very close in frequency to the colours that our eyes are sensitive to. 

When we mix light we are combining colours **additively**

The additive primary colours are:

- Red
- Green
- Blue

In science when we talk about mixing colours, we are talking about **Additive Mixing**. We are mixing light of different colours.

## Experimental notes

### Colour TV screen

Get students to look at a colour tv screen using a magnifier. Observe the pixels, and that they are made of 3 lights.

This is often better than trying to combine lights on a screen. The colours on a screen are rarely convincing.

### Web design colours

We can mix colours quite well using a screen using web technologies.  
See attached colours.html file - should just be able to open it in a browser.

Hex codes are usually 6 digits long, but can be 3 digits for ease of explanation. the numbering scheme is hexadecimal - ie 0123456789ABCDEF are the digits.

[Some examples can be found on this page](colours.html) If you inspect the elements you can change the colours. This page uses 3 digit hex codes.

- The first digit determines the strength of the red parts of the screens pixel
- The second digit determines the strength of the green parts of the screens pixel
- The third digit determines the strength of the blue parts of the screeens pixel
